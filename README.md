## Installation

First you need to download [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix), then simply run `nix-build` inside the directory to build the project and have the output in `result/bin/LoopConvert`. You can also run `nix-shell` to get into a development environment for the project. You can then manually use `Make` to build.
